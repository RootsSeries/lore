            Roots Lore
        </h1>
        <h2>Roots: Renewal of Bloom</h2>
        <p>
            The game that started it all! Originally, Renewal was not supposed to exist. Daniel wanted to make a VR game for this jam
            but could not get the headset to work. While he was struggling with the headset, Ravi designed a same-screen arcade combat 
            game just in case the headset proved to be unworkable. After a few hours, Daniel gave up fighting the headset and the team pivoted to implementing Ravi's 
            backup plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backup plan was quite different to what the final game became. Ravi's initial design was for a same-screen 
            top-down game where cactuses would shoot at each other in an old-western setting. Daniel pitched 
            changing the game's name (which at this point was <em>Rootin Tootin</em>) to <em>Roots: Renewal of Bloom</em>, parodying the WolverineSoft
            Studio game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074700/">Bloom: Roots of Renewal</a>. Ravi initially resisted this, thinking that nobody would get the joke
            but Daniel successfully convinced him. The team updated the design to better parody the studio game: the cactuses were changed to trees,
            and the setting was changed to an island in the middle of a lake. The same-screen top-down camera was changed to a split-screen third-person perspective.

        <h2>Roots: Eternal</h2>
        <p>
          <p>
            Incensed and inspired by the terrible theme, Daniel decided the series needed deep lore.             Quotes from the group chat:
 
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Daniel: i really want to inject lore into this<br>
                how do you all feel about a japanese narrated cutscene before the fight
              </p>
  
 			</blockquote>
  		  </p>
          
            Roots: Eternal is the first game in the series to feature the five main characters. These characters almost never happened.
            Ravi pitched the idea of creating four distinct characters instead of re-using the trees from Renewal, but Daniel initially didn't like the idea.
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Daniel: [Jojo's Bizarre Adventure image] but trees
              </p>
                <p>
                    Ravi:
                    we could do trees tho im thinking carrots and onions bc those are roots<br>
                    i have no idea why i thought of trees when we were making the first game tbh
                </p>
              	<p>
                  Daniel:
                  idk i think id prefer trees again to vegetables <br>
                  something about trees fighting is very amusing to me
               </p>
                
            </blockquote>
          It was only after some convincing that four distinct characters would make for better cutscene content that he agreed. 
          <p>
			Daniel created the character GGJ-San to personify the Global Game Jam, mocking them for the terrible theme. Not wanting to model a new character just
            for a cutscene, he decided to simply use the Unity default capsule and default material. GGJ-San speaks Spanish because Daniel
            was trying to find Japanese voice actors but not enough people were available at the time. Jos√©, one of the team members,
            speaks Spanish, so GGJ-San's language was changed to match. 
            
            <p>
              Initially, the game was intended to be a first person shooter
            like Doom, but the team changed the design to be a shared-screen suicide game because it would be easier to program and might
            fit the theme better. The first person shooter concept was eventually used in Roots: 2. Roots: Eternal set the precedents for 
            each game embodying a different genre and featuring multi-lingual cutscenes.

                    Nikhil Ghosh originally voiced the narrator, however the audio quality was unfortunately too low for Daniel to use in his cutscenes.

        <h2>Rootout</h2>
        <p>
            This was a solo project Ravi created during the Fall 2024 WolverineSoft mini-jam, in which participants created WarioWare-style 
            micro-games to add to a larger WolveyWare collection. This game is also the reason why GGJ-San's design is a pill on a box. In Eternal, Daniel intended the box
            to be be a pedestal GGJ-San was standing on, as though he was looking down on the people below. 
            When Ravi was drawing the animation for Rootout, he misinterpreted the box 
            GGJ-San was standing on as part of GGJ-San's body.

        This was created during a round of Comic Telephone at a Michigan Animation Club meeting in September of 2024. 
        Ravi drew the first panel, afterward handing off the page to other club members to draw. The other members had no knowledge of Roots, yet
        created a comic that fits remarkably well into the Roots universe.

            "Brainroot" is defined as:

                The unprompted and uncontrollable urge to reference Roots-related content in inappropriate and unrequested contexts. 
            </blockquote>
        It is a play on the term "brainrot."
