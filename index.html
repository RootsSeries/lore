        <h2>Roots: Renewal of Bloom</h2>
        <p>
            The game that started it all! Originally, Renewal was not supposed to exist. Daniel wanted to make a VR game for this jam
            but could not get the headset to work. While he was struggling with the headset, Ravi designed a same-screen arcade combat 
            game just in case the headset proved to be unworkable. After a few hours, Daniel gave up and the team pivoted to implementing Ravi's 
            backup plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backup plan was quite different to what the final game became. Ravi's initial design was for a same-screen 
            top-down game where cactuses would shoot at each other in an old-western setting. Daniel pitched 
            changing the game's name (which at this point was <em>Rootin Tootin</em>) to <em>Roots: Renewal of Bloom</em>, parodying the WolverineSoft
            Studio game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074700/">Bloom: Roots of Renewal</a>. Ravi initially resisted this, thinking that nobody would get the joke
            but Daniel successfully convinced him. The team updated the design to better parody the studio game: the cactuses were changed to trees,
            and the setting was changed to an island in the middle of a lake. The same-screen top-down camera was changed to a split-screen third-person perspective.

                    Nikhil Ghosh originally voiced the narrator, however the audio quality was unfortunately too low for Daniel to use in his cutscenes.

        <h2>Rootout</h2>
        <p>
            This was a solo project Ravi created during the Fall 2024 WolverineSoft mini-jam, in which participants created WarioWare-style 
            micro-games to add to a larger WolveyWare collection. This game is also the reason why GGJ-San's design is a pill on a box. In Eternal, Daniel intended the box
            to be be a pedestal GGJ-San was standing on, as though he was looking down on the people below. 
            When Ravi was drawing the animation for Rootout, he misinterpreted the box 
            GGJ-San was standing on as part of GGJ-San's body.
